Dear Fox Sports & MLB,

I tried to watch the World Series tonight, but it seems you haven't yet figured out a way to monetize a live stream of a World Series game and instead have chosen to black it out online. This, despite the fact that you broadcast this same game for free on TV.

It's 2012. If this is the best you can do, you're going to have a really bad time over the next five years. If you need any advice, feel free to get in touch.

Sincerely,  the Internet
